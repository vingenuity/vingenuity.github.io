After a year or so of being unsatisfied with my personal site at Squarespace, I've finally forced myself to take the jump to making my own custom website.

For this site redesign attempt, I'm going to try out hosting my site at GitHub Pages using Jekyll as a static site generator. This will definitely be interesting, as I haven't worked with any type of HTML or other web language in a long, long time.

Please pardon the mess as I get the site together!
